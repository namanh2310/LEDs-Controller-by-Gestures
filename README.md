## Hand Gesture Controlled LED Project

### Introduction
Welcome to our Hand Gesture Controlled LED Project! This project showcases how hand gestures can be used to control LEDs. By detecting hand gestures through a webcam, we interactively control the LEDs in real-time.

### Features
- Hand gesture recognition
- LED control based on gestures
- Real-time interaction
- User-friendly interface

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- LEDs
- Breadboard and wires

### About
Our Hand Gesture Controlled LED Project demonstrates a fun and interactive way to control LEDs using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques with MediaPipe, we detect hand gestures from a webcam feed and translate them into commands to control the LEDs. This project is a simple yet engaging demonstration of gesture-based interaction.

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the hand gesture recognition system.

Happy gesturing! üñêÔ∏èüí°
